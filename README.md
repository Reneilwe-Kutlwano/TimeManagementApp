#### =================OVERVIEW===================
This is an interactive time management application that is used to solve the problem of students not being able to efficiently manage their time correctly, so that they are able to plan their schedules ahead and submit their tasks on time. This application provides a seamless way to allow students to store the amount of hours they spend on a module and how many hours would remain after the hours they have spent prior, this provides a gauge on how much time you actually need in order to finish that task and submit it on time. The application makes use of user input which then takes the users input to provided a calculated measure of how many hours remain of their self study time for the week.

The motivation behind this application was to create something students can use, considering I am a student myself that will give me quick calculated answers of how much time I actually have left in order to submit tasks for certain modules. As a student time is something that is not on our side, so with this appliaction I wanted to make something fairly quick and easy to use to provide better time management for students. A little something to make life easier.


#### ============FEATURES OF THE PROJECT==============
This project includes the following:

1. Welcome page with a start button
2. Window that requests the user to enter their module code, name, number of credits, class hours per week, number of weeks and the start date for the first week.(This is where the user can add multiple modules if they have more than one module).
3. Window that requests the user to enter the number of hours they have spent of a specific module.
4. Custom library that calculates the hours of self study for each module the user entered and the number of hours remain after they have entered how many hours they spent on a module.(This uses LINQ)
5. User input validation to make sure the correct type of data is entered.
6. Displaying of the students modules and the hours that remain of self study.
